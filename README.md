**Introduction**

The Secant Method can be used to find a root, $x$, of a function $f(x)$ such that $f(x*) = 0$. This method is an adaptation of Newtonâ€™s method, where the derivative is estimated using the approximation $f'(x_k) \approx \frac{f(x_k) - f(x_{k-1})}{x_k - x_{k-1}}$. In the Secant Method, a sequence of successive estimates for $x$, labeled $x_k \geq 1$, are calculated using the formula $x_{k+1} = x_k - \frac{x_k - x_{k-1}}{f(x_k) - f(x_{k-1})}f(x_k)$. Geometrically, $x_{k+1}$ is obtained from $x_k$ and $x_{k-1}$ by intersecting the straight line through $(x_k, f(x_k))$ and $(x_{k+1}, f(x_{k+1}))$ with the x-axis. Since each calculation of the new estimate, $x_{k+1}$, requires the values of the previous two estimates, $x_k$ and $x_{k-1}$, we must specify $x_0$ and $x_1$ initially, choosing values that are close to the root we seek. Ideally, we should choose $x_0$ and $x_1$ in a similar way to the initial endpoints of an interval for the bisection method, such that $f(x) = 0$ precisely once in the interval $(x_0, x_1)$, though this is not necessary for the secant method to work.

**Code**

- The function `secant_method` below takes as input a function $f$, two real numbers $x_0$ and $x_1$, a positive real number $tol$, and a positive integer $k_{max}$. This function should implement the Secant Method to find a root of a function $f$ using the two starting points $x_0$ and $x_1$. Successive estimates should be calculated until the relative error $e_k$ is less than $tol$ or $k > k_{max}$.
- The function `secant_method_list` is an updated function that outputs a list of approximations.
- Using the function `secant_method_list` from the code above, with initial approximations $x_0 = -2$ and $x_1 = 1$, compute a list of approximations, $x_0, x_1, ..., x_N$, to the unique real zero of $f$ (which lies between $x_0$ and $x_1$). Illustrate the Secant Method by plotting the curve of $f$, the x-axis, the five points $z_i = (x_i, f(x_i))$ for $0 \leq i \leq 4$ on the curve, and the four straight lines (secants) between $z_0$ and $z_1$, $z_1$ and $z_2$, $z_2$ and $z_3$, and $z_3$ and $z_4$. The plot should have a size of $20 \times 10$ and be limited in both x and y directions in such a way that the relevant parts of the graphs and intersections are clearly visible. The function $f$ is defined as $f(x) = \frac{x^3 - x^2 + 2x + 1}{3x^2 + 2}$.

**Conclusion**

The first function is our main function, which represents the algorithm of the Secant Method, while the other two codes are to help display how the convergence takes place, as shown primarily in the graph for the third code.
